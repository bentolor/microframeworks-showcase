    content: in digital format on websites, blog posts, social media,
    advertisements, film and television productions, web and mobile applications
    in printed materials such as magazines, newspapers, books, brochures,
    flyers, product packaging for decorative use in your home, office or any
    public place or personal use

    The rights granted to you by FreeImages.com are: Perpetual, meaning there is
    no expiration or end date on your rights to use the content. Non-exclusive,
    meaning that you do not have exclusive rights to use the content.
    FreeImages.com can license the same content to other customers. Unlimited,

    any media.

    For purposes of this agreement, “use” means to copy, reproduce, modify,

    use of.

    Please make sure you read the Restricted Uses section below for exceptions.

    Restricted Uses.

        No Unlawful Use. You may not use content in a pornographic, defamatory
        or other unlawful manner.

        No Standalone File Use. You may not use content in any way that allows
        others to download, extract, or redistribute content as a standalone
        file (meaning just the content file itself, separate from the project or
        end use).

        No Use in Trademark or Logo. You may not use content as part of a
        trademark, design mark, tradename, business name, service mark, or logo.

        Sensitive Use Disclaimer Required. If you use content that features
        models or property in connection with a subject that would be
        unflattering or unduly controversial to a reasonable person (for
        example, sexually transmitted diseases), you must indicate: (1) that the
        content is being used for illustrative purposes only, and (2) any person
        depicted in the content is a model. For example, you could say: “Stock
        photo.  Posed by model.”  No disclaimer is required for “editorial use
        only” content that is used in an editorial manner.

        No Products for Resale. You may not use content in connection with any
        goods or services intended for resale or distribution where the primary
        value lies in the content itself including, without limitation, cards,
        stationery items, paper products, calendars, apparel items, posters
        (printed on paper, canvas, or any other media), CDs, DVDs, mobile
        applications or other items for resale, license or other distribution
        for profit.  This includes “on demand” products (meaning products in
        which content is selected by a third party for customization on such
        product on a made-to-order basis), including, without limitation,
        postcards, mugs, t-shirts, posters and other items (this includes the
        sale of products through custom designed websites, as well as sites such
        as zazzle.com and cafepress.com)

        No Electronic Templates. You may not use content in electronic or
        digital templates intended for resale or other distribution (for
        example, website templates, business card templates, electronic greeting
        card templates, brochure design templates).

        No False Representation of Authorship. You may not falsely represent
        that you are the original creator of a work that is made up largely of
        licensed content. For instance, you cannot create a painting or
        deviation/manipulation based on licensed content and claim that you are
        the author. Intellectual property rights.

        Who owns the content? All of the licensed content is owned by either
        FreeImages.com or the artists who supply the content. All rights not
        expressly granted in this agreement are reserved by FreeImages.com and
        the content suppliers. Attribution.

            Do I need to include a photo credit? You do not need to include a
            photo credit for commercial use, but if you are using content for
            editorial purposes, you must include the following credit adjacent
            to the content or in audio/visual production credits:
            “FreeImages.com/Artist’s Member Name.”

            Do I need to include an audio and/or video credit? Yes, if
            technically feasible, you must include the following credit in audio
            or audio/visual productions: “FreeImages.com/Artist’s Member Name.”

        or deleted unless made in writing and accepted in writing by both
